# When_Nothing_works_2.0
This is my course project for CT30A3204 Advanced Web Applications cource. The project
is about implementing a system like Stack Overflow where users can register, login and post new 
code snippets. Authenticated users can post and comment content and like (give a thumbs up)
posts and comments. They can also edit their own bio. Non-authenticated can only view content. 
There is also search function and users can view each others profiles via clicking their name.  


The project documentation contains more detailed information about the project.
